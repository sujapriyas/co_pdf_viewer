This PDF Co-Viewer application enables real-time synchronization of PDF slides across multiple users. 
Designed for collaborative settings such as online presentations or virtual classrooms, this tool allows an admin or presenter to control the slide page while all participants view the same page in real-time. 
When the admin navigates to a different page, all viewer screens automatically update, ensuring everyone stays in sync.
